    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <p> Hunting Adeline picks up right after the end of Haunting Adeline, continuing the dark and intense story of Adeline and Zade as 
        they face even greater danger. After being kidnapped by a human trafficking organization, Adeline must survive captivity while Zade, 
        her stalker‑turned‑lover, desperately hunts for her using his underground network. Their separation forces both of them to confront 
        terror, trauma, and the darkest parts of their lives as they fight to reunite. When they finally come back together, their bond 
        strengthens even as they work to dismantle the powerful forces working against them. The novel explores survival, resilience, 
        obsession, and the blurred lines between love and vengeance in a raw and suspenseful conclusion to their story.
