    <hr> 

    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <p> King of Sloth follows Xavier Castillo, a charming but carefree billionaire heir who avoids responsibility and 
        procrastinates on his future — much to his father’s frustration. When he’s forced to work closely with his determined 
        and ambitious publicist, Sloane Kensington, their constant banter and clashes begin to spark unexpected chemistry. As 
        tragedy and shared challenges bring them ever closer, Xavier must confront his fear of commitment and the uncertainty of 
        his life goals. Meanwhile, Sloane grapples with vulnerability and letting go of her emotional walls as she gets drawn into 
        his world. Throughout the story, their slow‑burn romance transforms them both, revealing that love, trust, and growth can 
        come from the most unlikely matches.
