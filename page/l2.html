    <h1> King Of Pride </h1>

    <hr> 

    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <p> King of Pride follows Kai Young, a reserved and controlled billionaire heir who is focused on 
        securing a crucial CEO vote and maintaining his impeccable image. His orderly world is disrupted when he 
        becomes drawn to Isabella Valencia, a bold, impulsive bartender whose purple hair and carefree personality 
        are the polar opposite of everything he stands for. Despite the rules of the elite club where she works forbidding 
        relationships between staff and members, their chemistry grows too strong to ignore. As they navigate forbidden desire, 
        societal expectations, and personal vulnerabilities, they begin to break down each other’s emotional barriers. In the end, 
        the story blends romance, tension, and self‑discovery as both characters confront what they truly want — even if it means 
        risking everything.</p>
