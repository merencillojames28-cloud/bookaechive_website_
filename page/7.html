    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <p> A Curse for True Love follows Evangeline Fox as she wakes with no memory of the past year and believes she is 
        married to Prince Apollo. She must navigate a world of magic, deception, and forgotten truths while uncovering her 
        lost memories, confronting Jacks, and deciding where her heart truly belongs. Amid curses, danger, and impossible choices, 
        Evangeline learns the true meaning of love, sacrifice, and finding her own happily ever after.
