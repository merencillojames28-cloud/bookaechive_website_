    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <p> King of Greed follows billionaire Dominic Davenport, a brilliant and ambitious Wall Street magnate who has always 
        chased success and more, at the expense of everything else. Despite having a beautiful home and a wife he once loved, 
        his obsession with wealth and status leads to the collapse of his marriage to Alessandra Davenport. When Alessandra finally 
        walks away after years of feeling unseen and unprioritized, Dominic must confront the emptiness behind his greed and the real 
        cost of his ambition. As he fights to win her back, both Dominic and Alessandra face emotional truths about love, self‑worth, 
        and what it means to truly put someone first. The story ultimately becomes a powerful second‑chance romance about rediscovery, 
        growth, and choosing love over ambition.</p>
