    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <p> The Maddest Obsession follows Gianna Allister, a woman who hides her anxiety and vulnerability behind a 
        loud and confident exterior. When she meets Christian Allister, a man shaped by pain, loss, and obsession, 
        their connection quickly becomes intense and emotionally charged. Despite their fears and flaws, the two are 
        drawn together, challenging each other to face their pasts and the truths they’ve long avoided. As they navigate 
        jealousy, desire, and deep emotional wounds, their relationship forces them to confront what they truly want from love and life. 
        In the end, the story is about how two broken souls find strength and integration through each other in a world full of danger and 
        temptation.
