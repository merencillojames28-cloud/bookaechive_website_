    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <p> Haunting Adeline is a dark romance with psychological thriller and horror elements that follows Adeline Reilly, 
        a writer who inherits her great‑grandmother’s eerie Parsons Manor and soon realizes she’s being watched and stalked 
        by a mysterious man named Zade Meadows. As strange gifts and threatening signs escalate around her, Adeline tries to uncover 
        family secrets and the truth behind an old murder connected to the house, while her uneasy obsession with Zade grows despite 
        fear and danger. Zade, part of an underground group fighting human trafficking, blurs the line between protector and predator, 
        and their relationship becomes increasingly intense and morally ambiguous. Amid violence, mystery, and psychological tension, 
        Adeline faces threats from powerful enemies and must confront her conflicted feelings toward Zade as she fights to survive and 
        understand her past. The story blends romance, suspense, and psychological conflict, setting the stage for darker developments 
        in the series.
