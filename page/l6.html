    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <p>King of Gluttony follows Sebastian Laurent, the charming heir to a culinary empire who appears confident and successful but 
        hides deeper insecurities beneath his polished exterior. Throughout his life, his greatest rival — and secret obsession — has 
        been Maya Singh, a smart, competitive marketing executive who challenges him at every turn. When unexpected circumstances force 
        them to work together, the tension between them intensifies, blurring the line between hate and undeniable attraction. As they 
        spend more time in close proximity, both Sebastian and Maya must confront their feelings and grapple with how much they truly mean 
        to each other. Ultimately, the story explores how rivalry can transform into passion, showing that sometimes your greatest enemy 
        could become your greatest weakness — and your greatest love.
