    <h1> King Of Wrath </h1>

    <hr> 

    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <p> King of Wrath follows Dante Russo, a ruthless and controlling billionaire CEO who never planned to marry—until he’s 
        blackmailed into an arranged engagement with Vivian Lau, a poised jewellery heiress and daughter of his newest enemy. 
        At first, both view the marriage as a business deal: Dante wants to protect his reputation and eliminate the blackmail 
        threat, and Vivian wants to fulfill her family’s expectations. Reluctance and mutual mistrust define their early relationship, 
        but as they spend more time together, emotional walls begin to crack and passionate chemistry builds between them. Despite power 
        struggles, misunderstandings, and personal pride, they find themselves falling for each other, challenging their preconceptions about 
        love, control, and vulnerability. In the end, the story becomes not just about resisting desire but choosing love even in the face of 
        duty and expectation.</p>
