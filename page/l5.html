    <h2> Summary </h2>

    <p>King of Envy follows Vuk Markovic, a powerful and reclusive billionaire who has always avoided deep relationships — until 
        he finds himself drawn to Ayana Kidane, a glamorous supermodel engaged to his oldest friend. Though Ayana’s engagement is 
        actually a business arrangement to secure her freedom from an abusive agency, Vuk struggles with loyalty and desire as his 
        feelings for her grow. As their connection deepens, both must face the tension between passion and propriety, even though being 
        together could upend their lives. When Ayana’s wedding plans collapse and danger looms, Vuk becomes both her protector and temptation. 
        In the end, the story explores forbidden attraction, emotional vulnerability, and the cost of pursuing love against all odds.
